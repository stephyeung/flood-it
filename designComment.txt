This project involved a game. You start out with a board of random pixel block colors
and the goal is to get the entire board to have pixels of all the same color, which
is achieved by first changing the color of the top-left pixel, such that if the 
adjacent pixels are the same color as the new color, they form a bigger flooded area.

This program used Tkinter and also one random.choice function. The random function
created the board of random colors --the board is actually a list of these colors
and the drawCell function calls these colors, to be used by drawBoard.

The circles clicked uses mousePressed events for x and y in order to gauge if a
user has clicked within the circle or not. Once they click a circle, it calls a
recursive function which first checks if the old color is the same as the new
or if the current pixel is connected with the other pixels around it in the
flood area. If not, then the function changes the actual color in the list to the
new color, and then calls drawBoard again to change pixel color.

Color schemes were made by just defining a new list for the random.choice library
to pick and append to the board list.
